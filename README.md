After dipping my toes into the world of Vim scripting and theming, I decided to create my own. Dwarrowdelf is the result. Thanks to Alexander Gude's [Eldar](https://github.com/agude/vim-eldar) theme, pR0Ps' [Molokai Dark](https://github.com/pR0Ps/molokai-dark) theme, and the default [Elflord](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/colors/elflord.vim) theme for inspiration.

# Installation

To install dwarrowdelf, simply drop the `dwarrowdelf.vim` file into your `~/.vim/colors` directory, and add this line to your `~/.vimrc`:

```vim
colorscheme dwarrowdelf
```
